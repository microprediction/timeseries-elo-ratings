# timeseries-elo-ratings

This package (ahem usually) generates [Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/univariate-k_003.html) for time-series forecasting packages as a by-product of testing the same.

* [html leaderboards](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/univariate-k_003.html)
* [json leaderboards](https://github.com/microprediction/timeseries-elo-ratings/tree/main/leaderboards_json)

Uses the [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) package to compute Elos.
